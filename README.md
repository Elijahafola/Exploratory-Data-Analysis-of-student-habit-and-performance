Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Student Habits and Performance

Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset that captures students' habits and their impact on academic performance. The dataset includes various behavioral, demographic, and lifestyle attributes such as study hours, social media usage, diet quality, sleep patterns, exercise frequency, and exam scores.

Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that influence students' academic success. This will help in understanding factors contributing to better performance and identifying areas of improvement.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple features, including:
Study hours per day – The amount of time a student spends studying daily.
Social media and Netflix hours – Time spent on entertainment platforms.
Attendance percentage – Measures consistency in attending classes.
Diet quality and exercise frequency – Health-related lifestyle factors.
Parental education level – Potential influence on academic achievement.
Mental health rating – Self-reported mental well-being.
Extracurricular participation – Engagement in non-academic activities.
Exam score – The final metric of academic performance.

Key Analysis Performed
The project involves:

Data Cleaning & Exploration – Checking missing values, data types, and summary statistics.

Visualization & Insights:

Histogram of study hours – Understanding study time distribution.
Correlation heatmap – Analyzing relationships among features.
Scatter plot (Study Hours vs Exam Score) – Observing the direct impact of study habits.
Bar plot of diet quality distribution – Exploring students' nutritional habits.

Tools & Libraries Used
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
NumPy for numerical computations

Conclusion
The analysis provides a data-driven perspective on students’ habits and their impact on academic performance. Insights from the study could assist educators, policymakers, and students in optimizing study routines and lifestyle choices for improved success.
